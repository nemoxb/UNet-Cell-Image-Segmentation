# U-Net Cell Image Segmentation
Implemented the U-net architecture for cell image data segmentation using PyTorch to learn concatenation type of skip connections.
The network I implemented consists of a Two Convolution Block part, a Encoder Part and a Decoder Part.
Cell images are limited, so I did data augumentation by flip,rotation and gamma correction.
